# GhostKnife
Collection of 3-D printable plastic knife designs.
"Undetectable Knives" are now banned in NY and CA. The NY definition specifies "commercially manufactured", while the CA definition does not, so homemade plastic "knives" are technically legal in NY, but not legal in CA. 
The designs here are meant to be printed on standard 3-d printers in high tensile strength composite filaments. When using the designs contained within, please use all proper PPE and follow all applicable safety procedures.
