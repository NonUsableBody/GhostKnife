This project came about due to New York's new "Undetectable Knife" ban.
While these designs probably won't be as good as a factory made injection molded composite "knife" I've tested both the Push and Push v2 and found that they do a decent job as stabbing implements... although points do have a tendency to break. Even with broken tips though, they continued to work well.
Apologies for the potato images. My camera sucks. 
Tips and lessons learned below.

1. These are all Push knife/Dagger designs. Know your local laws as regards them prior to doing anything to get into trouble.
2. When printing these, if you're not using lost PLA casting, a high strength carbon fiber or glass reinforced filament is recommended. If you use a nylon based composite, remember to keep it dry, or you'll get shitty prints. Ask me how I know.
3. In your slicer, scale to 50% for printing. 
4. All except Push v3 may have problems with broken tips after use - however, Push v3 will also have the dullest point. 
5. Push and Push v4 may be used both in composites and in lost PLA casting, although the point may break in use.
6. Push v3 is for composites only. Well, I suppose you could try it in lost PLA casting, but good luck getting any sort of edge on it.
7. Push v5 is multi-part. The blade is too thin to be a workable composite design, and should be cast. The other parts may be printed or cast as desired.
8. For lost PLA casting of blades, bronze (copper mixed with approx 12% tin) or aluminum bronze (copper mixed with 10%-15% aluminum) should be used. Recommend aluminum bronze - it's stronger, and scrap aluminum is somewhat more available than scrap tin.
9. When lost PLA casting, remember to wear proper PPE and be safe.
