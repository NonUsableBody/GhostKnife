This project came about due to New York's new "Undetectable Knife" ban.
While these designs probably won't be as good as a factory made injection molded composite "knife", Push, Push v3 and Push V4 have all ben tested satisfactorily in Carbon Reinforced Nylon filament. Even with broken tips though, they continued to work well. They all offer a different set of compromises, as listed below:

Push : This is the first version. Features a "chisel" style edge, which should, if done as a lost-PLA casting project, be sharpenenable. In composites, this design works well, but is easily damaged.

Push v2: Deprecated

Push v3: Very robust, but also the least "sharp". Designed to provide the maximum strength while still having a somewhat usable point.

Push v4: Replaces Push v2. If cast, you should be able to put a usable edge on it. In testing of the Composite version, tip breakage was sometimes an issue.

Push V5. Meant for casting. Not robust enough to be workable in plastic composites. Parts other than blade may be printed. A1 variant removes need for a spacer. Not tested yet.
